  <h3>Create the Namespace</h3>

  <p>The following code creates a namespace for your application (called Todos), which is also an instance of
  SC.Application.</p>

  <p>It is important that every Ember app creates an instance of SC.Application, because it is responsible for
  routing browser events to your views.</p>

codeTarget: 'javascript'

code: |
  Todos = SC.Application.create();

validator: |
  if (!(context.Todos instanceof context.SC.Application)) {
    this.addError("Couldn't find valid MyApp instance");
  }

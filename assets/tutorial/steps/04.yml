  <h3>Managing the Model Using a Controller</h3>

  <p>Now that we know what our data looks like, let’s create a controller to manage it. Since we want to maintain an
  ordered list of todos, we’ll use an instance of <code>SC.ArrayProxy</code>.</p>

  <p>In MVC frameworks, like SproutCore, the controller layer bridges the model layer, which is only concerned with a
  pure-data representation of objects, and the view layer, which is only concerned with representing those objects.</p>

codeTarget: 'javascript'

code: |
  Todos.todosController = SC.ArrayProxy.create({
    // Initialize the array controller with an empty array.
    content: []
  });

validator: |
  if (!(context.Todos.todosController instanceof context.SC.ArrayProxy)) {
    this.addError("Couldn't find valid todosController");
  }

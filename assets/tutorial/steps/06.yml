  <h3>Creating New Todos with a Text Field</h3>

  <p>We’ve got our model and controller set up, so let’s move on to the fun part: creating the interface for our users.
  The first step is to create a text field into which the user types the name of their todo. SproutCore uses Handlebars
  templates to quickly define the application’s interface. While Handlebars makes it easy to markup HTML quickly,
  you’ll see that it also has been extended to automatically take advantage of SproutCore’s bindings.</p>

  <p>Here we’ll define a text field with a unique id attribute (so it can be styled via CSS), as well as a placeholder
  attribute that will be displayed in modern HTML5 browsers. For the ease of the tutorial, we'll set up this template
  in a view for you.</p>

codeTarget: 'template'

code: |
  <h1>Todos</h1>

  {{view SC.TextField id="new-todo" placeholder="What needs to be done?"}}

validator: |
  // TODO: Make this more specific
  if (context.$('input#new-todo').length !== 1) {
    this.addError("Couldn't find text field");
  }

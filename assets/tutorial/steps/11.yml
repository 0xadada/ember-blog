  <h3>Display Your Todos (cont)</h3>

  <p>Now is a good time to test out this code. Type a todo into the text field and hit return.</p>

  <p>Look at that! As soon as we create a new todo and insert it into the array controller, the view updates
  automatically.</p>

  <p>You’ve now seen a little bit of the power of Ember. By using Ember’s bindings to describe the
  relationship between your data and your views, you were able to change the data layer and let Ember do the hard
  work of updating the view layer for you.</p>

  <p>This is actually a core concept in Ember, not just something that demos well. Ember’s binding system is
  designed with the view system in mind, which makes it easy to work directly with your data and not need to worry
  about manually keeping your view layer in sync. You will see this concept over and over again in the rest of this
  tutorial and in other guides.</p>

  <h3>Getting Things Done</h3>

  <p>We now have the ability to add todos, but no way to mark them as done. Before the frustration of a never-ending
  todo list gets the better of us, let’s add the ability to mark todos complete.</p>

  The first thing we need to do is add a checkbox to each todo list item. As was mentioned earlier, if we want to
  handle events, such as user input, we need a view. In this case, we are adding a checkbox and want to be notified
  whenever the value of the checkbox is changed by the user. Let’s update the Handlebars template to look like the
  following:<p>

codeTarget: 'template'

code: |
  <li>{{view SC.Checkbox titleBinding="title" valueBinding="isDone"}}</li>

replacesCode: |
  <li>{{title}}</li>

validator: |
  // TODO: Write this

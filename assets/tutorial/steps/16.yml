  <h3>The More You Know (cont)</h3>

  <p>Now lets change set up our view to use this new property.</p>

  <p>While we're at it, lets also fix pluralization. Right now, if you only have one item, it will say "1 items", not
  so polished. To handle this, we'll create a new view that handles pluralization.</p>

codeTarget: 'javascript'

  Todos.StatsView = SC.View.extend({
    remainingBinding: 'Todos.todosController.remaining',

    remainingString: function() {
      var remaining = this.get('remaining');
      return remaining + (remaining === 1 ? " item" : " items");
    }.property('remaining')
  });

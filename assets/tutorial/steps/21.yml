  <h3>Marking All as Done</h3>

  <p>Let's say you've decided to actually get all of your work done. Wouldn't
  it be nice to have a way to easily mark every todo as complete?</p>

  <p>It turns out that, due to our application's declarative nature, all the
  hard work is already done. We just need a way to mark every
  <code>`Todo`</code> complete.</p>

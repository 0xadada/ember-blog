  <h3>Marking All as Done (cont)</h3>

  <p>If you were to reload your browser and use the app now, you'd notice that
  clicking all of the checkboxes of your todos will cause the
  "Mark All as Done" checkbox to become checked. However, it doesn't work in
  the other direction: clicking "Mark All as Done" has no effect.</p>

  <p>So far, our computed properties have described how to calculate a value
  from dependent properties. However, in this case, we want to accept a new
  value and update dependent properties to reflect it.  Lets update our
  <code>allAreDone</code> computed property to also accept a value.</p>

code: |
  allAreDone: function(key, value) {
    if (value !== undefined) {
      this.setEach('isDone', value);

      return value;
    } else {
      return this.get('length') && this.everyProperty('isDone', true);
    }
  }.property('@each.isDone')

  allAreDone: function() {
    return this.get('length') && this.everyProperty('isDone', true);
  }.property('@each.isDone')

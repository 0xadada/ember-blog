  <h3>Marking All as Done (cont)</h3>

  <p>If you use the app now, you'll notice that clicking all of the checkboxes
  of your todos will cause the "Mark All as Done" checkbox to become checked.
  However, it doesn't work in the other direction: clicking "Mark All as Done"
  has no effect.</p>

  <p>So far, our computed properties have described how to calculate a value
  from dependent properties. In this case, however, we want to accept a new
  value and update dependent properties to reflect it. Let's update our
  <code>allAreDone</code> computed property to also accept a value.</p>

codeTarget: 'javascript'

code: |
  allAreDone: function(key, value) {
    if (value !== undefined) {
      this.setEach('isDone', value);

      return value;
    } else {
      return this.get('length') && this.everyProperty('isDone', true);
    }
  }.property('@each.isDone')

replacesCode: |
  allAreDone: function() {
    return this.get('length') && this.everyProperty('isDone', true);
  }.property('@each.isDone')

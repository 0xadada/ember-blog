  <h3>Marking All as Done (cont)</h3>

  <p>When you set a computed property, your computed property function is
  called with the property key as the first parameter and the new value as the
  second. To determine if Ember is asking for the value or trying to set
  it, we examine the <code>value</code> parameter. If it is defined, we iterate
  through each <code>Todo</code> and set its <code>isDone</code> property to
  the new value.</p>

  <p>Because bindings are bi-directional, Ember will set
  <code>allAreDone</code> to <code>true</code> when the user clicks the
  "Mark All as Done" checkbox. Conversely, unchecking it will make Ember
  set <code>allAreDone</code> to <code>false</code>, unchecking all todos.</p>

  <p>Reload the app and add some todos. Click "Mark All as Done". Wow! Each of
  the individual check boxes gets checked off. If you uncheck one of them, the
  "Mark All as Done" checkbox un-checks itself.</p>

  <p>When you use Ember, as you scale your UI, you never need to wonder
  whether a new feature will work consistently with parts of the UI you already
  implemented. Since you build your view layer to simply reflect the state of
  your models, you can make changes however you want and see them update
  automatically.</p>
